# VRV-Security-s-Backend-developer-assignment-on-Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-
This repository contains the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as part of VRV Security's Backend Developer Intern Assignment. The project demonstrates a secure and scalable backend system to manage user roles and permissions efficiently, ensuring controlled access to resources based on roles.

# Features Implemented
User Authentication:
Secure login and registration functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
Passwords are encrypted using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to ensure data security.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Users are assigned specific roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
Permissions are granted based on roles to ensure controlled access to APIs and resources.

# API Design:
RESTful APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching users, roles, and permissions.
Endpoints are protected based on roles and permissions, ensuring secure access.

# Data Validation and Security:
Integrated input validation to prevent invalid data entry.
Implemented protection against vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

# Error Handling:
Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages to enhance debugging and usability.

# Scalability and Optimization:
Modular code structure for scalability and maintainability.
Optimized database queries using indexing and normalization techniques.

# Tech Stack
Backend Framework: [e.g., Node.js with Express.js, or Python with Flask/Django]
Database: [e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL]
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Tools: Postman for API testing, Git for version control

# How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-assignment.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd rbac-assignment

Install dependencies:
npm install  # For Node.js

Configure environment variables:
Set up .env file for database credentials and JWT secret keys.

Run the application:
npm start  # Start the server
Test APIs using Postman or a similar tool.

# API Documentation
Detailed documentation of API endpoints, request formats, and responses is provided in the repository (e.g., API_DOCS.md).

# Conclusion
This project highlights a robust implementation of RBAC for managing user roles and permissions in a secure and scalable backend system. It is designed to showcase best practices in backend development, security, and API design.
